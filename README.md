PGPro-NG is a fork of lucanaef's PGPro to fix issues and make further development.

## How to migrate from PGPro

1. Disable network access on your device.
2. Open PGPro. You should now be free from app crashes.
3. Export your keychain as needed, or use the old app.

PGPro can encrypt and decrypt messages as well as manage all your OpenPGP keys. It is free, simple and lightweight. Everything stays on your device. PGPro is made in Switzerland.
